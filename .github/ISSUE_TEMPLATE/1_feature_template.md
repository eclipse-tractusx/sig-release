## Architectural Relevance
<!--
The Architecture Management Committee monitors and controls the overarching architecture. It is essential that all applications and documentations follows a baseline set of standards and guidelines. These small checks ensure that the proposed change does not compromise our general principles.
-->
The following items are ensured (answer: yes) after this issue is implemented.

In the context of the standards [126](https://catenax-ev.github.io/docs/standards/CX-0126-IndustryCorePartType) and [127](https://catenax-ev.github.io/docs/standards/CX-0127-IndustryCorePartInstance), typically only one is applicable, depending on the specific use case. Please cross out one of the two standards that does not apply.

- [ ] This feature aligns with our current architectural guidelines
  - **Data Sovereignty:** All data sharing activities across company boundaries follow the [Catena-X Regulatory Framework](https://catenax-ev.github.io/docs/next/regulatory-framework/governance-framework), in particular the [Data Exchange Governance](https://catenax-ev.github.io/docs/next/regulatory-framework/20000ft/data-exchange-governance), and the [Dataspace Protocol](https://docs.internationaldataspaces.org/dataspace-protocol/overview/readme) via a compliant Connector (like the [tractusx-edc](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractusx-edc) or similar, see [Connector KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/next/category/connector-kit))

## Additional information
<!-- this is only needed, if contributors and committers are not known during feature creation -->
- [ ] I am aware that my request may not be developed if no developer can be found for it. I'll try to contribute a developer (bring your own developer)
