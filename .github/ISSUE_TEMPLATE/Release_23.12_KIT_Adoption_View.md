  - KIT Product Owner confirms: 
    - The KIT under review is compliant to all relevant Semantic Model Standards which are already published on the Association website. 
    - The content of upcoming Semantic Model Standardization Requests (STAN) has been reviewed and feedback was provided to the responsible PCA/BDA. 
    - An appendix has been created with a list of certification criteria (e.g., test cases) for the conformity assessment process. 

  _Best Practice:_
    - A KIT must link to the published semantic model standards on the Catena-X Association website.

    - Note: Failure to do so may ultimately make the KIT useless, as the mandatory CX Certification cannot be accomplished

    - Best case: Association Board approval is available and CX Standard is published on website.
    - Note: Please create and submit standards in time according to process and timeline > The [standardization process](https://confluence.catena-x.net/display/CXSTAN/The+standardization+process) (Source only accessible for Catena-X Consortia members in current transition phase.)
